# HDB-Simulation

This project aims to simulate the Housing Development Board's allocations of Singapore. Though it is worth to mention that many research papers have pointed out the briliance of this model in comparison with others around the world, from social welfare, real estate and housings' perspective, no official documentation explains explicitly the underlying mechanism and its correctness. With this in mind, we target to answer 2 primary questions:
* Is there any gap between the current solution and the actual optimal allocation, with and without ethnicity constraint?
* Can we propose a better approach?
